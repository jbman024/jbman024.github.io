<div id="content"><p><strong>Do you want to make your money work for you without having to pay ridiculous management fees to banks and financial advisors?</strong></p><img src="../images/Investing.jpg" alt="Passive Investing" width="159" height="165" style='float: right;'/>
  <p>I believe in passive investing that does not require you to constantly study the markets in order to make money. It has been proven that trying to time the markets is a losing game. My approach focuses on careful planning with regards to the initial set up of investments and then letting the power of automatic monthly contributions, dollar cost averaging  and index investing do the rest. Once the initial set up is complete, this is a very hands-off approach to investing that actually works!<br><br>Canada's mutual funds have some of the highest management fees in the world. The only explanation for it is that "<a href="http://www.financialpost.com/scripts/story.html?id=abf577f4-21d8-4c1e-8111-0da91fe1cd3a&k=15284">Canadian fees are so high because investors don't seem to care</a>". Some countries have regulations and laws that protect investor rights that includes maintaining reasonable mutual fund management fees. Unfortunately, Canada is not one of them and big banks/financial advisors have been robbing Canadians of their money for decades. The solution is to buy index funds and ETFs (Exchange Traded Funds) that track common stock indices with low fees. For example, S&amp;P/TSX Composite is the main stock index in Canada and contains stocks of the largest companies on the Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX). XIC.TO is an ETF that you would purchase through the Toronto Stock Exchange to track the S&amp;P/TSX Composite, which essentially means that you would own shares of all companies that exist in the S&amp;P/TSX Composite. If the Canadian stock market goes up, you make money! <br><br>Over the years, it has been shown that the stock market fluctuates rapidly but that it will always outpace inflation in the long-run. If you keep your money in index funds for multiple years, not only are you guaranteed to make money, but you will also beat the majority of financial advisors who claim to know how to 'time the market'. If people actually knew how to 'time the market' by selling at market peaks and buying at market lows then everybody who invested in the stock market would be rich. There needs to be winners and losers in every game and the stock market is no different. Index funds and ETFs don't try to beat the market, but instead just try to keep pace with the inevitable long-term gains. Index funds and ETFs have the huge benefit of charging the lowest possible management fees so that you get to keep all of the profits rather than having to fork it over to a financial advisor.
  <br><br> 
  The graph below illustrates the performance of the S&amp;P/TSX Composite since 1977. As you can see, there have been many peformance peaks and valleys over the years which investors call bull markets (periods leading to peaks) and bear markets (periods leading to valleys). The important thing to note here is that there is a significant upward trend. The graph shows that if you put your money into the stock market and just sit back without worrying about it for a few years, your money will grow and outpace inflation. If you had invested money into the stock market in 1977 so that it tracks the S&amp;P/TSX Composite (e.g. an index fund), your money would have grown by more than 1500%! And this doesn't even factor in the beauty of compound interest (&quot;interest on interest&quot;) that will be discussed later. That means that if you had invested $10,000 dollars into the an S&amp;P/TSX Composite index fund in 1977 and left it at the mercy of the markets, that money would now be worth more than $150,000.

<p><strong>Q: So what is this 'automatic monthly contribution' you speak of and how do I set it up?</strong></p>
<p>The most effortless and least stressful way to invest your money is to make it automatic. This can be done with both registered (e.g. TFSA, RRSP) and non-registered investment accounts but often follow a different procedure (e.g. have to fill out different forms). The process may differ slightly between banks/brokerages but in general it should be a relatively similar and easy process. This would be done AFTER you have opened your investment account with your chosen bank/brokerage. You must set-up a monthly contribution plan (MCP) to your TD Direct Investing (formerly TD Waterhouse) registered savings plan (RRSP or TFSA) from your regular chequings/savings bank account. Once your MCP is set-up you will want to create a Systematic Investment Plan (SIP) and Dividend Reinvestment Plan (DRIP) so that your money is automatically invested once it arrives in your investment account and dividends are automatically reinvested. After you've done this, sit back, relax and watch the money pile up! But in all seriousness, you should check in periodically to ensure that your MCP and SIP are running smoothly and to possibly 'rebalance' your investment portfolio to stick to your original allocations (% of portfolio). Here is a guide for setting everything up:</p>
<div id="checkmark_bullets">
<ol>
  <li class="style2">Download, complete and mail the Self-directed RSP Monthly Contribution Plan Authorization Form along with a void cheque (for chequings accounts) OR bank statement, direct deposit form and signed/stamped account info (for savings accounts).</li>
  </ol> 
<ul>
  <li class="style1">The MCP Authorization Form for TD Direct Investing can be found <a href="http://www.tdwaterhouse.ca/products-services/investing/td-direct-investing/accounts/forms-applications/forms.jsp?id=595680">here</a>. The form should be mailed to TD Waterhouse Cash Management Department, 77 Bloor St. West, 7th Floor, Toronto, Ontario, M5S 1M2</li>
  <li class="style1">Indicate the amount of each contribution and which day each month (e.g the 1st day of every month) you wish the money to be contributed. You can also indicate which month you would like this to begin if you didn't want to do it right away. Keep in mind that bank to bank transactions can often take a few days to process so if you want the money to be available on the 1st of each month then you should probably have it sent a few days before.</li>
  <li class="style1"><strong>IMPORTANT:</strong> The form states that you should include a 'void cheque' if your bank account is not with TD. This would not be a problem with a chequings account, but will likely not be possible if you want your money to come out of a savings accout. However, you can set up automatic withdrawals from a savings account if you provide the appropriate information to you bank/brokerage that you want to invest your money with. Call to find out what they need! For example, TD Direct Investing was able to create a monthly contribution plan for me with the money coming out of my PC Financial Interest Plus Savings Account after I provided them with a bank statement and direct deposit form (obtained through your PC Financial online account  under 'moving money' and clicking 'set up direct deposits'). I could have also sent a signed/stamped copy of my savings account info (had to call PCF to have this sent) if TD felt that this wasn't enough information, but it wasn't necessary in my case. These documents should include your bank code, transit number, branch name, account number and your name. TD has <a href="http://www.td.com/to-our-customers/tdhelps/#psce|cid=871|lid=1|tid=001|vid=e0268e2e3">stated</a> that  &quot;you have the option of sending this through without a void cheques, however if you do, please make sure that you have all your account information correctly inputted on the form to avoid delays in processing&quot;. It takes a bit more effort, but in the end I believe it is worthwhile since your money can accumulate interest in your savings account before it is withdrawn to your investment account.</li>
  <li class="style1">For non-registered accounts (aka cash accounts) at TD, you will need to fill out a Pre-Authorized Deposit Form istead of the MCP Authorization Form. You can find this form <a href="http://www.tdwaterhouse.ca/products-services/investing/td-direct-investing/accounts/forms-applications/forms.jsp?id=597300">here</a>.</li>
  <li class="style1">If you only want to add one large lump sum or if you want to add an additional contribution to your investment account, you can Also, depending set up your investment account (e.g. TD Direct Investing account) as a bill payment which will allow you to 'transfer' funds from the other institution to your investment account.</li>
  <li class="style1">There are no fees for setting up a MCP!</li>
  <li class="style1">There are no minimum amounts of money that must be transferred each month in order to set up a MCP. If you wanted, you could create a $5 MCP. Some savings is always better than no savings!</li>
  <li class="style1">Just because your money is going into a registered savings plan or an investment account does NOT mean that it is being invested. You will have to do some research to determine what you want to invest in. I have set up a MCP to TD Direct Investing and created a SIP (which is discussed next) for the TD e-series index funds. </li>
</ul>
<ol start="2">
  <li class="style2">Once you have set up your MCP, it's time to create a Systematic Investment Plan (SIP) so that your money is automatically invested. For TD Direct Investing Accounts, you must call to speak to an investment representative and have him/her set up the SIP. You can NOT do this online. You can also set up a Dividend Reinvestment Plan (DRIP) at this time.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li class="style1">If you are with TD Direct Investing, call 1-800-465-5463 or 416-982-7686</li>
<li class="style1">Inform the investment representative of how the money from your MCP is going to be allocated. For example, I have 35% of my monthly contribution invested in the Canadian e-series index fund, 35% in the U.S. e-series index fund, and the other 30% in the International e-series index fund. You can learn more about my strategy <a href="investing/index_investing/TD_eSeries.html">here</a>.</li>
<li class="style1"><strong>IMPORTANT:</strong> Make sure that the investment representative also knows that you want to automatically reinvest any dividends that you earn from your e-series index funds. This is called a Dividend Reinvestment Plan (DRIP) which &quot;allows you to purchase additional shares or mutual fund units automatically from the cash dividends paid on eligible securities, without incurring commission costs&quot;</li>
<li class="style1">There are no fees for setting up a SIP or DRIP! However, keep in mind that some brokerages charge commissions for buying certain investments (e.g. stocks, ETFs, etc.). You don't have to worry about these charges with TD e-series funds which is why I use a SIP and DRIP.</li>
<li class="style1"><strong>WARNING:</strong> The minimum amount you can invest in any one TD e-series fund using your SIP is $25. If you aren't using a SIP to invest your money and are buying it through your <a href="https://webbrokercpo.td.com/waw/idp/login.htm?execution=e1s1">WebBroker account</a> (TD Direct Investing's online trading platform) then you must invest a minimum of $100 for each e-series fund.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="3">
  <li class="style2">Check your investments periodically to ensure that your MCP and SIP are running the way you want them to (sometimes mistakes are made!) and rebalance your account every 3-6 months.</li>
  </ol>
<ul>
<li class="style1">It is a good idea to 'rebalance' your investment portfolio to stick to your original allocations. Your allocations are the percentage of the portfoilio that is apportioned to each specific investment and should have been determined prior to beginning a SIP.</li>
<li class="style1">For example, I try to stick to a portfolio that includes 35% Canadian e-series index fund, 35% U.S. e-series index fund, and 30% in the International e-series index fund. If the U.S. index fund does well then it will become a bigger part of your investment portfolio  then you may have originally wanted it to be (e.g. from original 35% to 37%) so you would sell off some units and add them to index funds/investments that did not do as well (e.g. Canadian e-series index may have dropped from 35% to 33% of your portfolio) to bring your investment portfolio back in 'balance'.</li>
<li class="style1">At TD Directing Investing, you will need to do this on your own by logging into your account.</li>
<li class="style1"><strong>IMPORTANT:</strong> TD e-series index funds have 30 day 'holding periods'. This means that if you sell units of a TD e-series index fund that you purchased within the last 30 days, you will be charged an additional fee (2% early redemption fee). Any units that have been held for longer than 30 days are free to sell. Keep in mind that it USED to be 90 day holding periods, so if you see this information on a website then it is outdated.</li>
