  <p><strong>Q: What's a credit score?</strong></p>
  <p>A credit score is a number that is given to you by credit-reporting agencies (such as Equifax and TransUnion in Canada) that indiates your credit trustworthiness. This number will be between 300 (worst) and 900 (best). A good score is considered to be anything above 680. A poor score is anything below 620.</p>
  <p>Your credit score is determined by a number of factors. It is based on your credit card history, cell phone plans, mortgage loans, etc. </p>
  <p>The biggest factor that influences your score (35% of how your score is calculated) is your '<em>payment history</em>' and this is determined by whether or not you pay your credit cards off on time. </p>
  <p>The '<em>amount of debt</em>' (30% of how your score is calculated) is also a large factor and is determined by how much debt you have at the time that your score is checked.</p>
  <p> Some smaller factors include your '<em>account history</em>' (15% of how your score is calculated), '<em>number of inquiries</em>' (10% of how your score is calculated) and '<em>types of accounts</em>' (10% of how your score is calculated).</p>
  <p> '<em>Account history</em>' is largely based on the average age of your accounts. A higher average age is better than a lower one. This is why many people will tell you not to close your oldest credit card account (assuming it doesn't have an annual fee).</p>
  <p>'<em>Number of inquiries</em>' is based on how often you apply for new products (e.g. new credit cards). Every time that you apply for a new credit card, you will get a 'hard pull' which means that a financial institution has looked at your credit report and score (with your permission). This will drop your credit score slightly. If you open a lot of new credit cards in a short period of time, this can be a warning sign for lenders as they may think that you are having financial issues. Keep in mind that when you are shopping for mortgages and/or home insurance, institutions will likely want to look at your credit score before approving you for a loan/rate. A 'hard pull' will be necessary when institutions are looking at your credit score, but it will only count as a single hit for your credit score regardless of how many institutions check out your credit report/score as long as your mortgage/home insurance shopping is all within two weeks of each other. Credit inquiries can stay on your report for 3-6 years, but older inquiries will have less of an impact on your score.</p>
  <p>A good mixture of '<em>types of accounts</em>' will positively influence your credit score. For example, showing lenders that you are capable of paying off different types of loans (e.g. mortgage, cell phone plans, credit cards) can increase your credit score.</p>
  <p><strong>Q: Why should I care about my credit score?</strong><br>
    <br>
    In Ontario, your credit score could be checked by mortgage lenders (e.g. banks), landlords when finding a tenant, home insurance providers, employers, etc. This can have an affect on the mortgage rate your receive, the home insurance premium you have to pay, etc.</p>
  <p><strong>Q: What happens when I open a new credit card account?</strong></p>
  <p>Your credit score will potentially go down a bit when you open a new credit card account but it will be a small drop at most. A 'hard pull' will be necessary when opening a new account and so that could drop your credit score slightly. The average age of your accounts would also be lowered and could impact your credit score. However, these factors would only influence 25% of how your credit score is calculated so it would not be a devastating blow to your credit score.<br>
  </p>
<br>
<p><strong>Q: How do I obtain a copy of my credit report/score? Does obtaining my credit report/score affect my credit score</strong>?</p>
<p>Obtaining a copy of your credit report or credit score is considered a 'soft pull' and will not affect your credit score. You can obtain your credit report (without your credit score) for free from <a href="https://www.consumer.equifax.ca/canada/home/en_ca_c/">Equifax</a> and/or <a href="https://www.transunion.ca/">TransUnion</a>. This is called a 'Consumer Disclosure' (it will cost you money if you want to see your exact credit score). It allows to see if there are any mistakes on your credit report so that you can clear them up before a mortgage lender checks into it. </p>
<p><img src="../home_ownership/how_to_buy_a_house_images/CIBC_credit_score.png" alt="CIBC Credit Score" width="161" height="183" longdesc="credit_score_images/CIBC_credit_score.png" align="right" vspace="10" hspace="10">Also, some banks will allow you to check your credit score for free. For example, with CIBC, you can access your credit score with the CIBC Mobile Banking app (so you can only check with your phone). Checking your credit score through the app does NOT negatively affect your credit score. However, it will only provide you with your overall credit score number and will not provide any details (e.g. credit cards on file, late payments, etc.) like the Equifax and TransUnion credit reports will. Here is a link to the <a href="https://www.cibc.com/en/special-offers/free-credit-score.html">CIBC Free Credit Score Service</a> for more information. Obtaining both the credit report (from Equifax or TransUnion) and credit score (from your bank) will allow you to get all the information you need for free.</p>
