  <p><em>*NOTE: This webpage  is currently a work in progress and is being updated for the 2018 tax returns (2019 tax season). The last update was on January 26, 2019.</em></p><br>
  <p><strong>Q: I'm a Canadian living in Ontario that wants to do my own tax returns. Where do I get started?</strong></p>
  <p>There are a number of different programs that will allow you to file your personal tax returns  in Canada. The most popular and highly reviewed programs happen to both be free and allow you to file your tax return completely online: <a href="https://simpletax.ca/">SimpleTax</a> and <a href="https://www.studiotax.com/en/">StudioTax</a>. I personally use SimpleTax but haven't heard any negative reviews of StudioTax so either would be fine. Since it is all done online, there is no need to mail anything in (e.g. slips, supporting documents, receipts) unless the CRA asks for them at a later date. Please note that you must be a resident of Canada in order to use SimpleTax or StudioTax as both programs use NETFILE (more on this later). NETFILE (and as a result both SimpleTax and StudioTax which are NETFILE ceritifed products) has a limit of 20 returns per account so it is not meant for professional tax preparers (who will instead have to use EFILE certified products).</p>
  <p>It is recommended (although not required) that you wait until around mid-March (or even the end of March to be safe) to start completing your tax returns as you should have all of your tax slips by then. </p>
  <br>
  <p><strong>Q: What if I don't want to do my tax returns online?</strong></p>
  <p>Well, you'd be in the minority since over 90% of Canadians file their tax returns online. BUT, you are in luck! The Canadian government (through the CRA) will release '<a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/tax-packages-years/general-income-tax-benefit-package.html">General income tax and benefit package</a>' each year but will not be available until mid-February which would allow you to complete your tax returns the old-fashioned way with pen and paper. You can download a PDF copy of the guide online, <a href="https://apps.cra-arc.gc.ca/ebci/cjcf/fpos-scfp/pub/rdr?searchKey=PKG&request_locale=en_CA">you can order a paper copy</a> (for free) or go to a local post office or Service Canada to get one. However, this DIY How-To guide is meant for Canadians who want to do their taxes online.</p> <br>
  <p><strong>Q: Can I do tax returns for my wife/husband?</strong></p>
  <p>Yes, you can! If you only want to do their taxes then there is nothing futher you need to do for that. However, if you want  to represent your wife/husband for their income tax  matters, access information or make limited changes to their account, then your husband/wife will have to authorize you as a <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/topics/authorizing-a-representative-overview.html">representative</a>. There are 2 levels of authorization: Level 1 authorization – Disclose information <u>and</u> Level 2 authorization – Disclose information and request limited changes. Even with Level 2 authorization, you will not be able to apply for child benefits on their behalf, change their address or telephone number, change their marital status, change their direct deposit information, manage their online mail, view/authorize/cancel other representatives or view/update children in your care. If you want to be able to do these things for them then you will need to look into becoming a legal representative which requires you to submit a legal document to the CRA.
</p>
  <p>Your wife/husband can give authorization online by logging into their 'My Account for Individuals'. They can give you online access OR (not and) telephone/in-writing access. If you want online access to your wife/husband's account, then you must register to <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/e-services/represent-a-client.html">Represent a Client</a> first by logging into your CRA My Account and obtaining a RepID. You can give this RepID to your wife/husband so that they can authorize you to access their account online through their My Account.</p>
  <p>You MUST obtain authorization from your wife/husband if you wish to use the Auto-fill my return service that is offered by SimpleTax (recommended).</p>
<br>
<p><strong>Q: What are some terms that I should know when doing my own taxes?</strong></p>
<p>Here are some common terms that will be helpful to know when preparing your own tax returns:</p>
<div id="checkmark_bullets"><ul>
  <li><strong><u>NETFILE:</u></strong> this is the electronic tax-filing service that enables Canadians to submit their individual income tax return directly to the CRA (Canada Revenue Agency) online. If you want to do your tax returns online (which is highly recommended), then make sure that the software program that you use to complete your tax returns is compatible with NETFILE. SimpleTax and StudioTax are both compatible with NETFILE. You must be a Canadian resident in order to use NETFILE.</li>
  <li><strong><u>T5 (Statement of Investment Income)</u></strong>:</li>
  <li><strong><u>EFILE</u></strong>: this is the electronic tax-filing service that is meant for Tax Businesses and Tax Preparers (e.g. if you are hiring someone to do your taxes), <u>not</u> individual filings.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p><strong>Q: When should I receive all of my 'tax slips'?</strong></p>
<p>All of your employment-related income slips have to be issued and  sent by the end of February. If you never got a slip then you should contact your employer. </p>
<p><strong>Q: When do I need to file my taxes by?</strong></p>
<p>There is a five per  cent late-filing penalty if you don't get your tax returns submitted by April 30 (or if April 30 falls on a weekend then you have until the following Monday) at the very latest. Even if you are a missing a tax slip, it is better to guess how much  you think you made and make a note on your return that indicates that you weren't  able to get your slip with the name/address of the person that was responsible for giving you that slip.</p>
<p><strong>Q: What else should I know about?</strong></p>
<p>Individuals in Ontario will receive a  tax-free 'Climate Action Incentive' payment after filing their 2018 tax  return starting in early 2019 (this is new as of this year in response to the new federal carbon tax). Climate Action Incentive payments in Ontario will be calculated as follows for 2019: $154 for a single adult or the first adult in a couple, $77 for the second adult in a couple and $38 for each child in the family. In 2020, these amounts will change to $226, $113 and $56. For 2021, they will be $295, $147 and $73. For 2022, they will be $360, $180 and $89. Rural residents (<a href="https://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2011/geo/map-carte/ref/cma_ca_ct-rmr_ar_sr/index-eng.cfm">outside of Census Metropolitan Area as defined by Statistics Canada</a>) will receive an additional 10% of the payment amount for the 'Climate Action Incentive' in recognition of their increased energy needs (e.g. transportation). <em>So how do I make sure that I get this?</em> You will need to claim the Climate Action Incentive payment on your tax return.  This will involve filling out a short schedule identifying the number of  adults and children in the family unit for which payments would be  claimed. There will be one claim per family.  <br>

<ul>
  <li class="style1">Use this link to register as an electronic filer</li>
  <li class="style1"></li>
</ul>
<ol start="3">
  <li class="style2">Obtain authorization  as a representative if you are preparing a tax return for a family member or friend (e.g. wife/husband) through the CRA</li>
  </ol> 
<ul>
  <li class="style1">This authorization will allow you to use the 'auto-fill my return' service that is offered through the SimpleTax software </li>
  <li class="style1">The authorization requires that you register to <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/e-services/represent-a-client.html">Represent a Client</a> first by logging into your CRA My Account and obtaining a RepID. You can give this RepID to your wife/husband so that they can authorize you to access their account online through their My Account. Your husband/wife will have to authorize you as a <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/topics/authorizing-a-representative-overview.html">representative</a> by clicking on the 'Authorize representative(s)' link on the main My Account screen then follow the instructions from there (it will only take a minute). Once they have authorized you, you can use the 'Auto-fill my return' service to access their tax information and file a return for them.</li>
</ul>
  <ol start="3">
  <li class="style2">Use the 'Auto-fill my return' service that SimpleTax offers to allow you to automatically fill out information needed for your tax return directly from the CRA</li>
  </ol> 
<ul>
  <li class="style1">If you have CRA MyAccount you can have SimpleTax or StudioTax autofill your return  with all the tax slips and information that the CRA has on file. This can complete up to half of your return instantly.</li>
  <li class="style1">Wait until mid-March (or even the end of March to be safe) to do this so that your CRA Auto-fill is as accurate as it can be. The earliest you use the auto-fill service for 2018 tax returns is Feb. 18, 2019 since that's when NETFILE opens. </li>
  <li class="style1">The CRA should have most tax information slips and other tax-related  information for the  tax year by mid-March but if some information is not available, it is possible that the CRA has not yet  received it. So you will want to double check your information at the beginning of April to ensure that there isn't any new information that was received a little later than expected. It is also up to you to double check that the information that the CRA auto-fills for you is accurate.</li>
  <li class="style1">The information that should be auto-filled include tax slips such as T3, T4 and T5 tax slips, Registered Retirement Savings Plan contribution limit, capital gains and losses, non-capital losses, capital gains deductions, Lifelong Learning Plan repayment amount</li>
  <li class="style1">
Can you split income from a T5 slip between you and your spouse? As per the CRA website, &quot;Once the Auto-fill my return service delivers the T5 slip into a  NETFILE-certified software, you need to report your share of interest  from a joint investment based on <em>how much you contributed to it</em>. You can  enter the percentage of interest directly in the software. The  difference would need to be declared by the other individual.&quot;</li>
</ul>

  <div id="checkmark_bullets"></div>
<br>
<p><strong>Q: What happens once I have finished filing my tax return online?</strong></p>
<p>Upon submitting your tax returns, you will get an immediate (within seconds) confirmation number indicating that the CRA has received your tax return. After you receive the confirmation number from the CRA, the CRA may need to contact you  to verify some information so you must ensure that a working phone number is provided on your tax return. </p>
<p>Once your return has been fully processed, the CRA will send you a <strong>notice of assessment </strong>in the mail (takes up to two weeks in the mail if you submitted your returns electronically) <u>OR</u> you can get it immediately after the return has been processed and received by the CRA using Express NOA which SimpleTax supports. A <strong>notice of assessment</strong> shows the date the CRA assessed your return and whether you have a refund, an amount owing, or a zero balance. It also includes a tax assessment summary and a RRSP/PRPP deduction limit statement. If you are registered for online mail, your notice of assessment will not be mailed to you but you will receive an email notification when new 'mail' is available for you to view in My Account. For security reasons, this email notification will not contain any links. If you are antsy, you can check your CRA My Account for your return status at any time.</p>
<p><strong>Q: How will I get my refund?</strong></p>
<p>If you are signed up for direct deposit and have provided  bank  account information to the CRA, the CRA can  directly deposit  your tax refund (if you get one). To sign up for direct deposit, you must complete and mail in  the Canada direct deposit enrolment form as it cannot be done online.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Oops! I've made a mistake on my tax return. Can I resubmit it?</strong></p>
<p>Starting February 26th, 2018, the CRA introduced the ReFILE service  to give taxpayers the option of having an amended income tax and benefit  return filed electronically. This service will let taxpayers use  NETFILE to send amended returns for a current  or previous   return and will only be accepted through ReFILE if the original return  was completed and sent electronically through NETFILE. To make  changes after you submit a return through NETFILE, you have  to wait for your Notice of Assessment. Once this has been received, you can to My Account and click 'Change my return' (this can be done for tax returns up to nine years ago). SimpleTax supports ReFILE.</p>
